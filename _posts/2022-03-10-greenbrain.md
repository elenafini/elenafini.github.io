Name of the project: **Agent-based modeling and radio frequency energy harvesting: a proposal for smart street lighting**.<br />

I presented a proposal to support the reduction of energy consumption by smart management of street lights.<br />
Street lights were modeled as a multi-agent system. I evaluated the energy requirements and elaborated a feasibility study for the project.<br />

The paper was submitted to an international contest called *Green Brain of the Year*, organized and hosted by Middle East Technical University. [The paper was awarded the third prize.](https://ncc.metu.edu.tr/announcement/2018-greenbrain-winners)
